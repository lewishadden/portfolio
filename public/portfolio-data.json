The client preferred Azure as their cloud provider, and I worked closely with them to ensure that my infrastructure design complied with their strict security standards. After collaborating with the client's security team, I created an optimal cloud infrastructure solution that met their functional and security requirements. I analysed the functionality of the microsite to gather the data requirements and used this to devise the most efficient database schema for Cosmos DB. I also created detailed architecture diagrams and a comprehensive technical design breakdown of the Azure architecture, including justifications and decisions made for each service, along with implementation and configuration steps.",
